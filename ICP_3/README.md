In this ICP3 , I've worked upon RWD ( how to create the responsive web pages) using Bootstrapping in task 2, i had created a web page that shrinks and expands according to the window size and also added the links of 3 projects which redirects to my web ICP's. In task-1 , i;ve developed a game (ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS) by using CSS and JS , where in Java Script we used a random numbers to play as against the computer and used CSS for styling my webpage.
